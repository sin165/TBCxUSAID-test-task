# TBC x USAID

A clone of the https://www.tbcacademy.ge/usaid page.

This is a test project for TBC Academy.

### Project structure
The structure of this project is simple: An HTML file, a CSS file, a JS file, a folder for images, and a folder for fonts.

### Technologies used
HTML, CSS, JS.

I chose to use JavaScript without any libraries because the instructions stated that it was preferred.
And since I was using vanilla JS, I decided to keep it simple and use CSS without any libraries.

### Instructions to run the project
Download or clone the repository and open the html file in any browser.
